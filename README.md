# Retro Football Shirts Store

* I'm into retro football kits so for one of my first projects I decided to build this landing page using HTML, CSS and plain javascript.

* It was built using Bootstrap to help structure the responsive layout along with some of my own custom styling. 

* It features a working shopping basket, which allows users to add/remove products to/from the basket, calculating a total cost.

* There's also a search option available for the user which filters through the products.

* Lots of plain javascript was used in the project including DOM manipulation, mapping, loops and event listeners.
